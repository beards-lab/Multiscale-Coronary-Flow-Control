The main sript to run is ExerciseSimulation\ExerciseModelRun.m

Three main folders are:

ExerciseSimulation

	This folder includes the scripts and functions for reading the parameters/data and integration of the two models.
	... (more to be added here)

	This folder includes the functions related to lumped parameter myocardial circulation model.
	... (more to be added here)

SRC_RepVessel
	This folder includes the functions related to representative vessel model.
